# this

> **this** is not an author-time binding but a runtime binding. It is contextual based on the conditions of the function's invocation. **this** binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but it has instead **everything to do** with the manner in which the function is called.

## call-site

> The location in code where a fucntion is called (not where is declared).
